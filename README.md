# 🤖 AI Customer Support Agent System

Welcome to the **SupportAgent2** repository!

This project is a modern, AI-powered customer support system built as a **Monorepo**. It simulates a real-world help desk where an AI understands your request and routes you to the correct specialist (Order, Billing, or General Support) to solve your problem.

## 🧐 Thorough Analysis: What Does Each Part Do?

Simple explanation suitable for anyone to understand!

### 1. The **ROOT** (`SupportAgent2/`)
This is the main container. It doesn't do the work itself, but **manages** the two big workers inside: `api` and `web`. It uses tools like `pnpm` and `turbo` to make sure both workers run fast and share tools.

### 2. The **BRAIN** (`apps/api/`)
This is the backend server. It's invisible to the user but does all the thinking.
*   **`src/agents/`**: This is where our AI characters live.
    *   **Router Agent**: The receptionist. It asks "How can I help you?" and decides where to send you.
    *   **Order Agent / Billing Agent**: The specialists. They have special instructions to handle specific tasks.
*   **`src/tools/`**: These are the "hands" of the AI. Providing capabilities like "Look up Order #123" or "Process Refund". Without tools, the AI can only talk; with tools, it can *act*.
*   **`src/chat/`**: This handles the flow of conversation. It makes sure messages go back and forth smoothly between the User and the Agents.
*   **`prisma/`**: This manages our long-term memory (Database). It remembers who the agents are and what their instructions are.

### 3. The **FACE** (`apps/web/`)
This is the website you actually see and click on.
*   **`pages/User.tsx`**: The Chat Interface. It looks like WhatsApp or iMessage. It displays the AI's response and lets you type.
*   **`pages/Admin.tsx`**: The Control Panel. This is for the "Boss". You can hire/fire agents (add/remove) and change their instructions (brainwash them) in real-time!
*   **`api/client.ts`**: The Messenger. It runs back and forth between the FACE and the BRAIN delivering messages.

## 🔗 How It All connects (Visual Flow)

Imagine you are sending a message. Here is the journey your message takes through the code:

```mermaid
graph TD
    User([👤 USER]) -->|Types 'Where is my order?'| UI[🖥️ FRONTEND (User.tsx)]
    
    UI -->|sends request| Client[📡 API CLIENT (client.ts)]
    Client -->|HTTP POST| Server[🚦 BACKEND SERVER (index.ts)]
    
    Server -->|Routes to| ChatService[💬 CHAT SERVICE]
    ChatService -->|Asks| RouterAgent[🔀 ROUTER AGENT (router.agent.ts)]
    
    RouterAgent -->|Decides: 'This is an Order question!'| OrderAgent[📦 ORDER AGENT (order.agent.ts)]
    
    OrderAgent -->|Uses Tool| DB[(💾 DATABASE / TOOLS)]
    DB -->|Returns: 'Order #123 is Shipped'| OrderAgent
    
    OrderAgent -->|Generates Reply| ChatService
    ChatService -->|Streams Text| UI
    
    UI -->|Displays: 'Your order is shipped!'| User
```

### In Simple Terms:
1.  **You** type in the **Web App**.
2.  The **Web App** calls the **Backend**.
3.  The **Backend** asks the **Router Agent** "Who should handle this?".
4.  The **Router** picks the **Order Agent**.
5.  The **Order Agent** checks the **Database**.
6.  The **Order Agent** writes a reply.
7.  The **Backend** sends the reply back to the **Web App**.
8.  **You** see the answer!

## 🚀 Getting Started: Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. 📥 Get the Code
*   **Clone the Repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SupportAgent2.git
    cd SupportAgent2
    ```
*   **OR Download Zip**: Extract the folder and open it in your code editor (like VS Code).

### 2. 📦 Install Dependencies
This project uses **pnpm** (much faster than npm). If you don't have it, install it via `npm install -g pnpm`.
Run this command in the **root** folder:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. 🔑 Configure Environment
Navigate to `apps/api/` and create a `.env` file (or rename `.env.example` if it exists).
Add your Google AI API Key:

```env
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=database_url_here
```

### 4. 🗄️ Setup the Database
We use **Prisma** with SQLite (no extra database installation required).
Go to the **root** folder and run:
```bash
# Push the schema to create the database file
pnpm --filter api prisma db push

# Seed the database with initial Agent data
pnpm --filter api prisma db seed
```

### 5. 🏃‍♂️ Run the Application
Start both the Frontend and Backend simultaneously:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
*   **User Interface**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
*   **Admin Dashboard**: [http://localhost:5173/admin](http://localhost:5173/admin)
*   **API Server**: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
